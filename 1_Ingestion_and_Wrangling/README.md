# Ingestion and Wrangling
## First step in data science pipeline
* demo_dl_from_worm.py - script showing use of boto3 to download files from Amazon S3 via python code
* ingestion.ipynb - notebook that injests the raw datasets from S3, performs dropping and other data cleaning, and merges the four datasets. It outputs a dataframe **../data/dataset_from_ingestion.ipynb** and some temporary cache files
