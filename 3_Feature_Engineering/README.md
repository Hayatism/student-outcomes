# Feature Engineering
## This step is after exploration and before modeling. It outputs two dataframes **../data/dataset_minimal_features_for_modeling.csv** and **../data/dataset_max_features_for_modeling.csv**
* feature_engineering.ipynb - create features from common sense and interaction terms, remove features with recursive feature removal, feature importances, save out one-hotted dataframes ready for modeling. Some classification modeling is in this notebook too.
